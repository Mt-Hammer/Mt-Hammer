# Driving on the bus with Gradma

I took a motherfucking bus ride,
Tooo-tooo-tooo-tooo,

30 munites into the bus ride,
Said - nigga we're going the wrong way,
There's no forest here today, 
Only big-ass sittaay.

She said holy-tittay,
We're gonna turn that ass around,
And I was like granny don't worry,
I'll turn that frown right upside down. 

Tooo-too-too-tooo
Tooo-neeew-teeww


# My baby girl
I said see you later
Drove all the way to your aunt's house,
Without... you better not film this nigga, it's direspectful, you're making me shy and taking me out of my element.

Oooooh-oooh
I got this fine young mama sita sitting next to me,
Oh baby girl she's fine as she's carresing me,
I met her, on the tinder, wait no just kidding,
It was hinge haha,
She likes my, she like my motto,
I said I like yours too,
She say - what that mean, 
I said what does yours mean too?
KISS - keep it simple stupid,
I said - ok sounds good to me, 
SO imma keep it simple as you say, 
Next thing you know. 
I'm at her friend's house that she's babysitting for,
WHo's she is babysitting though, it's a cat
She's a little baby girl and she like to purr and hoe,
