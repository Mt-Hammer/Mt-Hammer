## Good old songs

## Driving on the bus with Gradma

I took a motherf$*%king bus ride<br>
Tooo-tooo-tooo-tooo<br>

30 munites into the bus ride<br>
Said - ni$$A we're going the wrong way<br>
There's no forest here today<br>
Only big-ass sittaay<br>

She said holy-tittay<br>
We're gonna turn that ass around<br>
And I was like granny don't worry<br>
I'll turn that frown right upside down<br>

Tooo-too-too-tooo<br>
Tooo-neeew-teeww<br>


## My baby girl
I said see you later<br>
Drove all the way to your aunt's house<br>
Without... you better not film this nigga, it's direspectful, you're making me shy and taking me out of my element.

Oooooh-oooh<br>
I got this fine young mama sita sitting next to me<br>
Oh baby girl she's fine as she's carresing me<br>
I met her, on the tinder, wait no just kidding<br>
It was hinge haha<br>
She likes my, she like my motto<br>
I said I like yours too<br>
She say - what that mean<br>
I said what does yours mean too?<br>
KISS - keep it simple stupid<br>
I said - ok sounds good to me<br>
So imma keep it simple as you say<br>
Next thing you know<br>
I'm at her friend's house that she's babysitting for<br>
Who's she is babysitting though, it's a cat<br>
She's a little baby girl and she like to purr and hoe<br>
